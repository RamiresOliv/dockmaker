Other very important stuff:

book.json is where you will set the book informations.
settings.json is how dockmaker will take care of your project while is in the machine.

Q: How I publish this to github pages?
A: uh.. Good question. Try just posting the content made in the directory "site" (It's possible. No jk.)

Q: About the cli commands?
A: just use dockmaker help <command> to see what the command does and how to use.

Q: Others specific things?
A: Wait for full documentation.

Thats all, thanks for be using this project <3
